class GSettingsLogger(object):
    '''Logs all GSettings changes.

    This class monitors the ca.desrt.dconf.Writer interface directly for
    "Notify" signals.  This allows it to capture change notifications for
    both fixed path AND relocatable GSettings schemas.

    Logging changes for fixed-path schemas is trivial, because the path is
    encoded into the schema itself.  So given the changed path, it's just a
    reverse-lookup to find the fixed-path schema.

    Logging changes for relocatable schemas is more complex because it
    involves guessing.  It uses a process of elimination to determine which
    relocatable schema is in use at a particular path.

    There's a fixed set of relocatable schemas, each of which defines a set
    of keys.  As we receive change notifications for a path which we know is
    using a relocatable schema, we accumulate a set of changed key names for
    that path which serve as clues.

    On the first notification for such a path, we evaluate ALL relocatable
    schemas and select candidates which satisfy the initial changed key set.
    This can yield an ambiguous result if multiple relocatable schemas define
    the key(s) we know have changed.  Only one of the candidate schemas is
    the correct one, but regardless we create a Settings object for each
    candidate schema at the same path.  (It turns out GLib doesn't care; its
    enforcement of relocatable schemas is surprisingly weak.)

    This CAN yield bogus change entries in the log (right key, wrong schema).

    As the changed key set for that path expands from further notifications,
    we reexamine the candidate schemas for that path and eliminate those that
    no longer satisfy the (expanded) changed key set.  When only on candidate
    remains, we can conclude with certainty which relocatable schema is in use
    at that path.
